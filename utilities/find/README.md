There is a python parallel version here:
git@github.com:johnbent/pwalk.git
It requires python 3.

Once you get it, then to run it you edit the 'setup_find' function in the base
'io500.sh' to turn it on.  Also, it relies on the 'pfind.sh' script in this
directory which assumes that you do the git clone in this directory.
