Hopefully that all just works and you are up and running with a trivially sized problem using the default serial find.  To improve it, edit i0500.sh one function at a time to grow the problem size and to switch to the provided python parallel find. You may also need to take whatever steps necessary to run it with a job scheduler. If it doesn't just work, please let us know why not and we'll fix it.

Thanks for your participation and good luck!  Please see [our documents directory](https://github.com/VI4IO/io-500-dev/tree/master/doc) for more detailed instructions including how to submit once you have successfully run.
