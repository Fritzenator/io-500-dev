```bash
git clone https://github.com/VI4IO/io-500-dev
cd io-500-dev
./utilities/prepare.sh
./io500.sh
```

Hopefully that all just works and you are up and running with a trivially sized problem using the default serial find.  If so, just edit io500.sh one function at a time to grow the size of the problem and to switch to the parallel find.  If it doesn't just work, please let us know why not and we'll fix it.

Thanks for your participation and good luck!  More detailed instructions available in README.detailed.md.
